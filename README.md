# Tic-Tac-Toe-
This repository contains a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Java. The game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other in a 3x3 grid, where they must try to form a line of three matching symbols (either "X" or "O") either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.
